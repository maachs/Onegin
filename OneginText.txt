My uncle has the most honest rules,
When I seriously fell ill,
He forces himself to respect
And I couldn't think of anything better.
His is an example of another science;
But, my God, what a bore
With a sick chair both day and night,
Read it without leaving a single step!
My deceit is low
Half-dead to have fun,
His pillows are being adjusted,
It's sad to bring medicine,
Sigh and think about yourself:
When will the devil take you!
